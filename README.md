# AutoDoc-ChatGPT

This is a ChatGPT based prompt generation model for MidJorney. The purpose of this model is to simplify the creation of images and increase their creativity. By introducing a partial hint, ChatGPT creates a follow-up that can be used to stimulate creativity and provide new ideas.

## Usage

### Edit config

Open `config.ini` and add `email` and `password` there if you are not using OAuth authorization.
Otherwise open [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) and get the `__Secure-next-auth.session-token` cookieand write it to the `session-token`.

### Start

```bash
py main.py -file "path to the file"
```

The path to the file can be either relative or absolute.

After execution, the file `yourfilename_commented.language` is created in the folder with the desired file.

You can also use this as a function in python.

```python
from modules.autodoc import AutoDoc
import configparser

config = configparser.ConfigParser()
config.read("config.ini")

auth = {
    "email": config["ChatGPT"]["email"],
    "password": config["ChatGPT"]["password"],
    "session_token": config["ChatGPT"]["session_token"]
}

result = AutoDoc(
        auth,
        "Code for commenting",
        "language code. P.S. See Supported languages",
    ).start()
print(result)
# out: Code with comments
```
